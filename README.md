Interactive Tabbed Interface developed to support user experience of the academic Reservoir Simulation software that I helped to develop in my Master's thesis.

This interface significantly simplifies the process of controlling simulation input data, offering an intuitive alternative to the conventional method of editing text files. The project highlights my capabilities in developing practical software solutions, user interface design, and effectively integrating Python programming with the PyQt5 framework to enhance user experience in academic and technical software applications.
